# Big City RWG
# Author: Zorora
## 7 Days to Die Mod

Tweaks the RWG to more readily produce maps with a megacity or several larger cities. It does this by making several tweaks but the most important ones are:

1. Disables mountain spawning.

2. Adjusts spawn weights for various districts and enable city districts in towns. Oldwest towns no loger spawn, but are instead capable of spawning in cities as a "historic district."

3. When using the "Few" option for the number of cities, only 1 or 2 cities can spawn and are required to spawn with a large number of tiles.

4. When using the "Many" option no cities will spawn, but many towns requiring a larger number of tiles will spawn instead. These towns have had all city districts enables for them. They are now functionally cities even if labelled as towns programatically.

5. Requires that at least 1 of each trader should spawn.

Known issue:

1. Because a megacity requires so many tiles, index out of bounds errors can be generated if the megacity grows beyond the map size or biome border it originally spawned in.  It is recommended to use this mod only for map sizes of 4K and higher as well as sticking to single biome maps when trying to spawn a megacity with the "Few" option.
